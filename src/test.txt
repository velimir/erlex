Write a function that will print this in a readable form,
so that duplicates are removed and adjacent numbers are put into a
range. You might like to think of doing this via a function which turns
the earlier list of occurrences into a list like
[{1,2},{4,6},{98,98},{100,100},{102,102}]
through a sequence of transformations.
